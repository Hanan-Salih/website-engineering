                        <h2>The "Nakba"</h2>
                        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Palestinian term that expresses the humanitarian tragedy endured by the Palestinian people due to their displacement and expulsion from their homes outside Palestine, especially in 1948 when the state of Israel was established. The term encompasses a painful history of occupation, displacement, massacres, and the destruction of Palestinian properties. The Nakba is considered a symbol of Palestinian identity and significantly impacts their culture and daily lives. Although it is a historical event from the past, it still profoundly affects the contemporary Palestinian reality, making it a constantly relevant term.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">In October 2023, a military escalation occurred between Palestinian resistance factions and Israel, as Palestinian fighters crossed the Israel-Gaza barrier and fired rockets into Israel. In response, Israel declared war on Hamas and imposed a comprehensive blockade on the Gaza Strip. More than five months later, the UN Security Council issued a resolution demanding a ceasefire in Gaza during the month of Ramadan, with widespread international support. Jordan, in cooperation with Egypt, also announced its intention to send aid to Gaza through the Rafah crossing. At the same time, Egyptian security sources warned of attempts to liquidate the Palestinian territories.</p>

                            Journalists in Gaza face particularly high risks as they try to cover the conflict during the Israeli ground assault, including devastating Israeli airstrikes, disrupted communications, supply shortages, and extensive power outages.

                            CPJ is investigating all reports of journalists and media workers killed, injured, or missing in the war, which has led to the deadliest period for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992.
                            As of April 8, 2024, CPJ's preliminary investigations showed at least 95 journalists and media workers were among the more than 34,000 killed since the war began on October 7—with more than 33,000 Palestinian deaths in Gaza and the West Bank and 1,200 deaths in Israel.

                            Artists are processing the crisis in a myriad of ways: through paintings of the horrors of war, through anguished song and in dance. The work has been shared in places like Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, where protesters regularly gather to demand the release of Israeli captives being held by Hamas, and on social media, where a Palestinian diaspora say they can more safely post their work than those still living under the Israeli government.

                            As the war between Israel and Hamas drags on, many on both sides have taken to social media to gather information and air their outrage. The impulse to do so is understandable: Political activism on social media provides people with an emotional outlet and gives them a sense that they can do something. The war is awful, and following it generates a sharp psychological need to get involved and do something.

                            Hundreds of thousands of people are taking to the streets across the world to protest against the war in Gaza, as it nears the 200-day mark, and to demand an end to Israel's offensive.
                            Its arguments were based on its alleged right to self-defence following the attack by Hamas in southern Israel on October 7, which killed 1,139 people, as well as what it said was a lack of genocidal intent against the Palestinian people.

                            Businesses across the corporate world are seeking to find a balance in their responses to the war that don’t offend users, partners and their own employees. As universities dealing with irate donors have found, that isn’t easy.
