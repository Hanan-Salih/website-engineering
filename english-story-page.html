                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    His hair is curly, white and sweet... Words that may seem normal to you, but they tore all of our hearts to pieces. Seeing these words on social media pages is like crying and feeling helpless and sad... These words appeared in a video that was circulated of a Palestinian doctor and his wife searching for their child among the injured and dead bodies after the bombing operations from Before the Israeli occupation.

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    The seventy-year-old man whose two sons were martyred, said to those around him to strengthen them in the face of the scenes of death surrounding them: You are thirsty, man! You are a man. We are all martyrs. We are all legitimate martyrs. Say, “To God we belong and to Him we shall return. Oh God, reward me for my calamity and give me something better than it.” What is wrong with you, my uncle? Strengthen your wits. This is the land of jihad and the land of bondage. We are all for the sake of God.

                    The collapse and crying of a Palestinian woman who went to get flour and returned to be surprised that her house had been bombed by Israeli warplanes above the heads of her family members. The woman screamed over the rubble of her house and said, “They are all inside... I went to get the flour... my husband and my children,” while the sound of aircraft rose above the area.

                    “I swear by the life of our Lord, I am afraid” are words chanted by a fleeing Palestinian child at the moment the Israeli occupation army bombed the Al-Shifa Complex and its surroundings. The words of the child who was searching for a safe place to take refuge while carrying his little brother’s bed were spread across social networking sites.
